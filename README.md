# This repository is just me documenting my Rust learning journey and it's based on the official rust book and the std documentation
## If you intend to depend on this repo to understand or tackle rust lang topics I suggest you focus on these resources as well:
1- The Official Book https://doc.rust-lang.org/book

2- The reference https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference   I would suggest to not dive too deep into this just look into it if you're lost about a topic

3- The standard library https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/index.html

4- For youtube based learners:
